# Session Log — 2025-12-08 14:34

- Context:
  - Initial PREPARATION pass; repository currently empty.
  - Goal: scaffold agent docs, headers, golden rules, and template.

- Planned To-Dos:
  - [x] Create `ai-agent-docs/` structure with start, role, golden rules, template.
  - [x] Add AI-AGENT-HEADER blocks to new docs.
  - [ ] Scan application code and add headers (blocked: no source files yet).

- Progress (paths + notes):
  - Added `ai-agent-docs/AI-Agent-Start.md` with workflows, links, line-sync guidance.
  - Added `ai-agent-docs/agent-role.md` defining responsibilities and operating notes.
  - Added `ai-agent-docs/golden-rules.md` with initial GR-001..GR-003.
  - Added `ai-agent-docs/templates/session-template.md` for future logs.
  - Added session log `ai-agent-docs/session-logs/SESSION-20251208-1434-.md`.

- Decisions and assumptions:
  - MCP Context-7 to be used for external tech once code exists.
  - Line-sync script not present; manual line-range maintenance required after edits.

- Open tasks for next session:
  - Scan new code (when added) and attach AI-AGENT-HEADER blocks with line ranges.
  - Expand `AI-Agent-Start.md` with project architecture once code is available.
  - Update Golden Rules as patterns emerge during implementation.

- Candidates for Golden Rules:
  - None beyond GR-001..GR-003 yet; revisit after first code additions.
